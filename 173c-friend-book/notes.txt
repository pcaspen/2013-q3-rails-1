Subject: [DVC] Copy over migration from 173f to 173c

Hi everyone,

Please run the following commands to work on 173f:

mkdir db/migrate
cp -iv ../173f-friend-book/db/migrate/20130817233454_initial_schema.rb db/migrate

Oops, the cp command might not work in Windows -- use Explorer instead, to copy the migration
file by hand from db/migrate in 173f to db/migrate in 173c.

That will give you the database migration file.
