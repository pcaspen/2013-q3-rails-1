Hi everyone:

The rake db:seed and rake db:reset commands won't work on exercise 149 if you have Ruby 1.9.3 instead of Ruby 2.0.0.  You can find out what version of Ruby you have by running:

ruby -v

Fortunately there's an easy fix.  Add the following line to the top of db/seeds.rb in the 149c directory:

# encoding: UTF-8
